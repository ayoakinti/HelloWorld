            My name is <strong>Ayomide Akintimehin Olawale.</strong> I really do love programming and all the things that have to do with it.

            I had a very cute best friend, and her name is Jessica Godwin. I called her my shugar and I still love her soooo much.

            Some people think I'm weird sha, but that's their own business. I think I am just unique and special, and loved soooo much by God. He is gracious and kind to me.
